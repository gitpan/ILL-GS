Biblio::ILL::GS version 0.03
============================

Biblio::ILL::GS is a little bit of glue.... 

Our library web site (http://maplin.gov.mb.ca) uses Perl (of course)
and Z39.50 to enable our libraries to search for and request items
amongst themselves (and, for that matter, to/from the world at large).

The basic procedue is: find the item, parse the resulting record,
build a human-readable email out of it, and send it - all automagically.

One of our libraries has moved to an interlibrary-loan management system,
and would rather not have to re-key this data as it arrives.  Their
system, however, does have the ability to process requests in the
Interlibrary Loan Generic Script (GS) format.

Biblio::ILL::GS simply lets you build a GS format message.

Integrating it with your existing system is left as an excersise for
the reader....
